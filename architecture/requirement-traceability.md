# Requirement Traceability Matrix

This document traces business requirements to the architecture artifacts under `./architecture`.

## Requirement Assessments

### 1) App_as_Code_001

**Requirement Summary**
- Deployment and configuration should be automated.
- Deployment should be repeatable across environments.
- Scope clarification provided: manual HLD approval is acceptable; from ServiceNow request approval onward, the process should be automated.

**Status**: **Met** (based on clarified scope)

**Traceability Evidence**
- `architecture/aws-migration-cicd.mmd:52-54`  
  `A11 -- Yes --> A9` shows transition from approved ServiceNow request to CI/CD handoff.
- `architecture/aws-migration-cicd.mmd:57-109`  
  Stage 2 onward models system-driven build, gates, AWS role assumption via OIDC, Ansible build/configuration, AMI registration, CMDB patch, and promotion deployment.
- `architecture/sequence-diagram.mmd:12-40`  
  ServiceNow webhook triggers GitHub Actions; subsequent execution flow is automated through AWS SSM/EC2 and CMDB callback.
- `architecture/target-component-context.mmd:65-77`
  Pipeline-driven promotion and repeatability controls are modeled (release manifest, approved AMIs, `dev -> test -> prod` progression).
- `architecture/full-pipeline-tech-stack.md:12-14,21,25`  
  Ansible and Terraform automation, environment parameterization, and release manifest support consistent, repeatable deployments.

**Architect Verdict**
- The architecture fulfills App_as_Code_001 when interpreted as: manual governance up to ServiceNow approval is allowed, and all post-approval deployment/configuration execution is automated and repeatable.

### 2) App_as_Code_002

**Requirement Summary**
- Continuously detect unauthorized/unsupported configuration drift in in-scope workloads.
- Automatically remediate drift so live state returns to repository-approved baseline.

**Status**: **Met**

**Traceability Evidence**
- `architecture/component-context-diagram.mmd:74-78`  
  Runtime findings and inventory state are fed back from runtime/SSM inventory into ServiceNow for continuous visibility.
- `architecture/full-pipeline-tech-stack.md:6,18-19,22`  
  The solution defines remediation runbooks as code, continuous runtime security posture monitoring, and inventory reconciliation.
- `process-flow-diagram.md:59-63`  
  Post-build SSM document includes inventory capture and remediation baseline, with evidence looped to ServiceNow.
- `architecture/target-component-context.mmd:49-56,91-100`
  Adds explicit scheduled reconciliation control, live-vs-repo drift comparison, policy gate, baseline enforcement, and convergence verification loop with compliance evidence feedback.
- `architecture/target-component-context.mmd:58-63,102-105`
  Adds dedicated database drift detection/remediation lane, including migration orchestration, rollback path, and post-remediation validation.
- `architecture/sequence-diagram.mmd:48-63`
  Models closed-loop control flow end to end: detect drift -> policy/approval decision -> enforce repository baseline -> verify convergence -> publish closure evidence.
- `architecture/sequence-diagram.mmd:65-79`
  Models dedicated database drift trigger, remediation decision, migration execution, rollback, and validation reporting.

**Architect Verdict**
- App_as_Code_002 is now explicitly evidenced with continuous reconciliation controls, a closed-loop remediation path to repo baseline, and a dedicated database drift control lane.
